- [andrej karpathy - intro to llms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g)
    - great high level overview of the topic, shareable with others, does not require much prior knowledge
- pydata
    - [vincent warmerdam - Keynote "Natural Intelligence is All You Need"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9p7suS-NGk)
        - use the hiplot library to visualize parallel coordinates
            - interesting way to easily visualize areas in binary classification feature space dominated by a single class, to develop simple rules as powerful features
    - [Forecasting Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) for Marketing Campaigns under Uncertainty with PySTAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQST0RnN_o)
        - dataset used
            - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/baetulo/lifetime-value?select=train.csv
        - website for talk with code
            - https://raphaeltamaki.github.io/raphaeltamaki/posts/Forecasting%20Customer%20Lifetime%20Value%20-%20Why%20Uncertainty%20Matters/
        - uses half cauchy as priors a bunch, worth considering
        - look up pymc's implemention of marketing mixture models 
    - [Okke van der Wal - Personalization at Uber scale via causal-driven machine learning | PDAMS 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_dOpCvkNc0)
        - also discusses CausalML (works at uber)
        - seems like a very strong framework for evaluating strategies for prioritizing contact among set of leads towards the most persuadable
    - [Ana Chaloska - To One-Hot or Not: A guide to feature encoding and when to use what | PDAMS 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Opsiqj6gcY)
        - try taking the log of the target encoding as well
    - [Cikla & Zhutovsky - Transfer Learning in Boosting Models | PyData Amsterdam 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmQw_B-JP9o)
        - lgbm has  `booster_.refit(data, label, decay_rate=0.9, **kwargs)`
            - where the data  and label is the new records
        - you can also add trees at the end of the process by makng another classifier with an init_model
            - lgb.LGBMClassifier().fit(X, y, init_model = original_model)
                - X is the new features
                - y is the new labels
        - possibly a interesting way of quickly updating a model
    - [Van den Bossche - What the PDEP? An overview of some upcoming pandas changes | PyData Amsterdam 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z47QwqDUKTo)
        - in pandas 2.0 , there's a `pd.options.mode.copy_on_write = True`
            - this gets rid of the copy warning and means that all modification only apply to current df, which massively speeds up chained operations
            - there's a pyarrow string dtype in 2.1, 
- AI Engineer Summit
    - [Pydantic is all you need: Jason Liu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj-wSRJwrrc)
        - discussion of a bunch of patterns for trying to introuce broadly understood and testable OOP patterns into the construction of LLM apps. Lots of good examples and motivating ideas, no link to the code and at the end of the talk, the QR code didn't show up in his slide

- tutorial
	- [Polars: The Next Big Python Data Science Library... written in RUST?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHqn7ufiilE)
                - summary of how to do basic operations in polars
                        - this is a df analysis library written in rust

- [George Hotz | Programming | what is the Q* algorithm? OpenAI Q Star Algorithm | Mistral 7B | PRM800K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QO3vzwHXhg)
	- recording of 4h live stream of Hotz
		-  watched first hour 2023-11-27
			- going over Q*
			- usiing a fine tuned 7B model called open hermes 2.5 and integrating it with tinygrad
